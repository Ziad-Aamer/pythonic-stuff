REPL: read-evaluate-print loop, an interactive execution of commands, which is usually a characteristic of interpreted languages like python.

*Quotes*: 
-  Firmly establishing what is to be done before thinking about

Every collection in python implements 3 interfaces (ABC or abstract base class): Iterable, Sized, Container.
These are used implemented by the collections:
* Sequence -> e.g. lists 
* Mapping -> dict 
* Set
